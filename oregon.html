						<!-- !!EDIT!! Toplines -->
						<ul>
							<li>
								Pandemic evictions occurred most in downtown Portland and in surrounding areas near Vancouver WA, Gresham, and Beaverton. All other major Oregon towns had sizable evictions with noticeably high rates in north east, central, and south west Oregon.
							</li>
							<li>
								Eviction rates fell close to zero in the early months of the pandemic and rose to over 50% of historical average in July 2021, towards the end of the CDC Moratorium, surpassing historical
								average in June, August, and September of 2022.
							</li>
							<li>
								Though 2022 is not over, eviction rates are already higher than 2020 and 2021 both overall and for each racial and ethnic group:

							<ul>
								<li>
									1 in 57 renters experienced an eviction filing (1.8%)

								<li>
									1 in 58 Latine and White renters experienced an eviction filing (1.7% & 1.8%)
								</li>
								<li>
									1 in 41 Black renters experienced an eviction filing (2.5%)

								<li>
									1 in 42 “Other Group” (mixed-race, Indigenous, and other racial/ethnic groups) renters experienced an eviction filing (2.4%)

							In collaboration with Portland State University's <a href="https://evictedinoregon.com" target="_blank">Evicted In Oregon</a> team, UC Berkeley's Eviction Research
							Network and Urban Displacement Project analyzed eviction filings in the state of Oregon

							proceedings have begun. Depending on the situation, households may leave anytime prior to a notice to after an eviction lawsuit.

					<h2>Moratoriums greatly reduced evictions</h2>

				<i>Data collected by Portland State University. Analysis by The Eviction Research Network, 2022</i></p>
				<!-- !!EDIT!! numbers -->
				<p>
					After the first eviction moratorium in March 2020, eviction cases dropped drastically to just over 100 cases for all counties in Oregon. The number of cases each month steadily increased until July 2020 after which they plateaued through December 2020. The CDC moratorium issued in September 2020 does not account for any significant decline in cases for the latter half of 2020.
				</p>
				<p>
					The case count each month steadily increased throughout 2021 until July, which experienced the largest month to month change in case counts since the start of the pandemic. Case counts plateau for the remainder of the year at this level until a steep increase at the start of 2022 that continues to increase until a brief decline in July 2022. An increase happens again in August followed by a slight decline in September 2022.
				</p>
				<p>
					The counties in the graph above are ordered by the average number of evictions across the
					entire time period.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>Note that data is updated as recent case information becomes available.</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					The content of this graph is repeated in tabular form in the appendix.

					The graph above compares pandemic eviction rates to pre-pandemic averages. Bars that extend
					above the dashed line represent months where rates were higher than the historical average
					for that month, while bars below the dashed line represent months where rates were lower
					than the historical average for that month.
				</p>
				<p>
					November is the lowest historical average month at 1,114 eviction filings while January is the highest historical average at 1,691.
				</p>
				<p>
					Following the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, the evictions for each month of the pandemic are below 25% of their
					historical average for the entirety of 2020. January 2021 starts below 25% but climbs to 50% by July and does not fall
					below this value for the remainder of the study period. While there is seasonality to pandemic eviction cases relative
					to the historical average starting with July 2021, each peak and trough in 2021-2022 are higher than those that came
					before which indicates a slow but steady return to to pre-pandemic monthly eviction filings, which does occur in June, August and September of 2022.

				<!-- Evictions by race -->
				<!-- !!!EDIT!!! takeaway, numbers, & text -->
				<h2>Black and "Other Groups" disproportionately evicted</h2>
				<p>
					The race and ethnicity of named parties per eviction filing were estimated using their last
					name and the demographic information of the census tract in which they lived. While our
					methodology gives good overall estimates, the results may be biased toward the racial
					majority in the corresponding tracts.
				</p>
				<iframe class = "desktopShow" src="plots/race.html" width="100%" height="400" scrolling="no" seamless="seamless" frameBorder="0" data-external="1"></iframe>

				<p style="font-size:70%" align="right">
				<i>Data collected by Portland State University. Analysis by The Eviction Research Network, 2022</i></p>
				<p>
					The graph above shows eviction rates by race and ethnicity and reveals the disproportionate
					impact evictions have on Black and 'Other' renters in Oregon - the eviction filing rate for these groups is greater than all other groups throughout the entire study period. The total number of renters per census tract by race and ethnicity in Oregon come from the ACS 2016 - 2020 5-year estimates. This value is the denominator of the eviction filing rate, with the numerator being the estimated race and ethnicity of those listed in the case. The eviction filing rate is then the percentage of renters in each group that we estimated to be the
					defendant of an eviction filing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Latine and White eviction rates remain similarly throughout the 6
					years while Asian eviction rate remains the lowest and the stablest throughout the 6 years
					comparing to the other ethnic groups.
				</p>
				<iframe class = "desktopShow" src="plots/race_ratio.html" width="100%" height="400" scrolling="no" seamless="seamless" frameBorder="0" data-external="1"></iframe>
				<img class = "mobileShow" src="plots/race_ratio_mobile.png" width="100%" height="auto">
				<p style="font-size:70%" align="right">
				<i>Data collected by Portland State University. Analysis by The Eviction Research Network, 2022</i></p>
				<p>
					This graph demonstrates the amount by which the estimated eviction rates of Asian, Black,
					Latine, and "Other Group" renters compare to the estimated eviction rate for White renters.
					A ratio greater than 1 (dashed line) means that there is a greater eviction filing rate for
					non-White renters than White renters. A ratio less than 1 means the opposite - there is a
					lower eviction filing rate for non-White renters than White renters.
				</p>
				<p>
					As noted in the chart above, Black and 'Other Group' renters were above the overall eviction
					filing rate for the entire study period. This is apparent again in the eviction filing rate ratio to White renters.
					Latine eviction rate fluctuates mildly over and below the 1 ratio line while the Asian to White eviction ratio ranges between .6 - .8 over the study period.
				</p>
				<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
				<p>
					As noted earlier, the demographic information is estimated by combining the probability of
					someones race or ethnicity based on their surname and informed by the racial composition of
					the census tract where they lived. The segregation map layer shows a majority of census tracts
					are 'mostly white'. This means it would be more likely than not that a
					mis-classification would estimate 'White', due to the demographic composition of the census tract
					to which the case was mapped. Therefore, these graphs are a conservative estimate of the racial disparity in eviction
					cases.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, the use of eviction filings in our data underestimates the real number of households
					that were forced to leave. Many households leave after a notice and prior to a filing while
					others may leave if threatened with an eviction before a notice. These latter occasions are
					considered “illegal evictions.” Alternatively, not all eviction filings lead to a removal as
					some may work out a deal with their landlord to stay. At this time, these data do not allow
					us to track these types of moves or stays, however we are constantly working on solutions to
					try and get at these types of statistics.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, it should be noted that for the purposes of this report, '2022' ends with September
					2022. There is still time left for these yearly average rates and ratios to change and
					trends that are observed now may be quite different by December.
